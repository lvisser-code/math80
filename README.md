## Integer and floating point math routines for 8080 &amp; 8085 microprocessors
Intel 8 bit microprocessors have very limited math cabability built into the instructions set. If your application needs to perform 16 bit integer math or floating point math then give these routines a try.
* 16 bit signed and unsigned integers.
* 32 bit floating point numbers.
* Fits within 4k of memory.
